<div id="history">
  <h3>Ancient History</h3>
  <p>Action Hank were formed in 1995 when <%= profile_link('ben') %> taught <%= profile_link 'thom' %> to play the bass guitar so they could play covers of <a href="http://www.greenday.com/">Green Day</a>, <a href="http://www.terrorvision.co.uk/">Terrorvision</a> and <a href="http://www.weezer.com/">Weezer</a> songs in his bedroom.</p>
  <p>In 2001 <%= profile_link 'thom' %> returned from <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/" title="Aah, the 'brystwyth: consonants rule!">university</a> in <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=52.4154&amp;lon=-4.0816&amp;scale=100000&amp;icon=x" title="It's a place, dogg.">Wales</a> with knowledge of how a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020806180617/http://www.thecheapskates.com/" title="Check out The Cheapskates web site, from before it got hijacked by pornographers!">real band</a> works, that he learned from a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/siadwell8089/CheapPage.htm" title="Matt Redd, of Good Clean Fun Records!">rotund and good-natured Welsh entrepeneur</a>. Armed with this knowledge, but saddled with an <a href="http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/recruitment/shift.php" title="Stay in the pub, all the time">all-time-consuming job</a>, <%= profile_link 'thom' %> thought of one bass-line and a name &#8211; <em>Kid Twist and The Skam!</em> &#8211; one of which was good, and one of which was not.</p>
  <p>Losing the job and gaining time, <%= profile_link 'thom' %> and <%= profile_link 'ben' %> were able to recruit their first Matt &#8211; bass-player, nee second guitarist, <%= profile_link 'mattbass', 'Matt' %> &#8211; and have a practice in <%= profile_link 'ben' %>&#39;s back garden, with rare appearances from Mandy on the bongos and Becky on the <a href="http://www.informatik.fh-hamburg.de/~windle_c/TableHooters/Yamaha_SHS-10.html" title="Cometh the hour ... COMETH THE BEAST!">guitar keyboard</a>!</p>
  <p>An advert placed on <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=internet&amp;r=67" title="Whoa, whoa: the what, now?">the internet</a> provided a drummer: Leo, a middle aged american jazzer, who decided after twenty minutes that it wasn&#39;t for him. However, with three hours and forty minutes practice time left, our heroes pressed on. With two hours to go, Jonny, the manager of the <a href="http://www.backlinestudios.freeserve.co.uk/">practice studios</a>, arrived and said that he&#39;d seen their poster and fancied a go!</p>
  <p><em>The Hank Was Born!</em></p>
  <h3>Step Two: Horns</h3>
  <p>It was obvious that horns were required, so <%= profile_link 'thom' %> called in an old, old friend with whom he hadn&#39;t spoken in years. <%= profile_link 'chris' %> could play the clarinet and it was hoped that he could step up to take the mantle of saxophonist. <%= profile_link 'chris' %> said yes &#8211; but only owned a soprano saxophone, which is widely regarded as <a href="http://www.musicbybob.com/photos/Bob-action.jpg">a &#8216;gay&#8217; instrument</a>. So they stuck with the clarinet which turned out to be a much better idea.</p>
  <p>One down, some to go. A poster in <a href="http://www.whsmith.co.uk/" title="Go to that venerable stationers&#39; site">WHSmith</a>, of all places, was enough to yield three! more! horns!</p>
  <p><%= profile_link 'ali' %> (trombone), was cajoled into joining, which was good because she is the only trombone player in britain not already attached to a band. Then Laura was bullied into joining on alto sax. She was a bit nervous at first, but was telling <%= profile_link 'chris' %> off regularly after only a few weeks! And lastly <%= profile_link 'matttrumpet', 'Matt' %> on trumpet. The boyfriend, at the time, of <%= profile_link 'thom' %>&#39;s, <%= profile_link 'ali' %>&#39;s and Laura&#39;s boss, this was a dangerous move, but all turned out well and the hank had reached its final, frightening, proportions!</p>

  <h3>Then ...</h3>
  <p>A few upheavals and a dozen or shows later, it&#39;s the year 2005. Laura left to go to university; Jonny left to spend time with his family and his other bands; and his replacement, Matt, left after a few months to go round the world. He may even now be humming &#8216;<%= link_to("Swings And Roundabouts",:controller => 'songs',:anchor => 'swingsandroundabouts') %>&#8217; forlornly to himself in a Brazilian jail cell.</p>
  <p><%= profile_link 'jon' %> is Mr Drums now, and more &#8211; a legendary box of percussion equipment is his legacy as the scion of a drumming dynasty stretching back into ancient times.</p>

  <p>Oh, and we don't practice at <a href="http://www.backlinestudios.freeserve.co.uk/">Backline</a> no more, either &#8211; we is hooked up in a <a href="http://www.gardenstudios.net/doc_rehearsalpics.htm">portacabin</a> at <a href="http://www.gardenstudios.net/">Nev&#39;s</a>!</p>
  <h3>Lately</h3>

  <p>Well we finally found a practice studio with modern gear like at Nev&#39;s, and the relaxed atmosphere like at Backline, except a bit cleaner! Of course we are talking about <a href="http://www.silenthillstudio.com/">Silent Hill</a>. Now <em>that</em> is what I am talking about.</p>
